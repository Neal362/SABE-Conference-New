      <h2 class="subhead">Welcome to Dearborn</h2>
      <p>
        Dearborn is located in Southeast Michigan and is part of the Metro Detroit area. Long
        known as the birthplace of Henry Ford, Dearborn is a city of innovation and immigration,
        where families from around the world came to build a life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, Dearborn is a rich, vibrant, multicultural community where church bell towers stand
        next door to mosque minarets, and where you can find both some of the best
        <em>pączki</em> and shawarma in the United States. Dearborn is also known as the
        <strong>Coffee Capital of Michigan</strong>, with more than 45 coffee shops to explore.

      <h2 class="subhead">Discover Dearborn</h2>
      <p>
        Dearborn’s modern growth was boosted in 1917 when Henry Ford built the Ford Rouge
        Plant here. As Ford Motor Company expanded, Dearborn became its world headquarters,
        and the city now features two walkable downtowns (east and west) with restaurants,
        cafés, shops, and museums.
      </p>
      <p>
        The area around the University of Michigan–Dearborn offers easy access to historic
        sites, cultural institutions, and a wide range of dining options, all within a short drive or
        rideshare from campus.
